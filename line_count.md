# Line Counts

Though not the only factor or even most important factor, the amount of code it
takes to achieve a working product is an important consideration when comparing
frameworks.

This is an imperfect line count comparison -- some of the samples contain a bit
more functionality / are structured a bit differently than others -- and should
be taken with a grain of salt. All generated files, blank lines and comment 
lines are removed for this comparison.

For authors of frameworks or samples (hey, I'm one of those!): Please do not 
take this comparison personally, nor should folks play "Code Golf" with the
samples to make them smaller, unless doing so improves the application overall.
