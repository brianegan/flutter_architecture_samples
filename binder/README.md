# binder example

This sample makes use of the [binder][https://github.com/letsar/binder] library to manage state.

## Key Concepts

  * States are referenced through `StateRef` instances.
  * Logics are referenced through `LogicRef` instances.
  * States can only be updated through business logic components (aka logics).
  * More information on how binder works [here][https://github.com/letsar/binder].
